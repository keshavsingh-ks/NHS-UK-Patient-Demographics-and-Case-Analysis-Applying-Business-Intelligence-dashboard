# NHS-UK-Patient-Demographics-and-Case-Analysis-Applying-Business-Intelligence-dashboard

Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of NHS UK's operational data from 2019 to 2022, using Tableau for data visualization. The focus is on patient demographics, case dynamics, and critical care metrics. The visualizations aim to uncover key insights into NHS service delivery, regional disparities, and operational efficiencies. This analysis is designed to guide NHS country directors in making informed decisions that enhance patient care, reduce waiting times, and optimize resource allocation.

Problem Statement
The NHS faces ongoing challenges in managing patient care efficiently across its diverse services, exacerbated by external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Fluctuations in service demand, regional disparities in healthcare delivery, and resource constraints have highlighted the need for a data-driven approach to operational management. This project seeks to address these challenges by providing clear, actionable insights into NHS operations through advanced data visualization techniques.

Solution
Leveraging Tableauâ€™s powerful data visualization capabilities, this project analyzes key datasets to identify trends, inefficiencies, and disparities within the NHS. The solution involves creating interactive dashboards that visualize patient demographics, service demand, critical care metrics, and regional performance. These visualizations provide NHS decision-makers with the insights needed to make data-driven decisions, ultimately improving healthcare service delivery and patient outcomes.

Key Features
Demographic Analysis:

Age and Gender Distribution: Visualizations reveal the distribution of NHS service usage across various age groups and genders, highlighting the necessity for targeted healthcare services.
Top Age Groups: Analysis identifies the most frequent users of NHS services, emphasizing the growing demand for geriatric care.
Operational Efficiency:

Total Attendance and Service Demand: Analyzes service demand fluctuations over the years, providing insights into how external events like the COVID-19 pandemic impact healthcare accessibility.
Critical Care and Bed Availability: Visualizes critical care admissions and bed usage, offering a clear understanding of resource constraints and capacity challenges.
Regional Disparities:

Regional Wait Times and Length of Stay: The analysis uncovers significant regional disparities in waiting times and lengths of stay, guiding the reallocation of resources and process optimization.
Impact of Therapist Feedback:

Correlation Between Feedback and Patient Progress: Demonstrates how effective therapist feedback correlates with improved patient outcomes, emphasizing the importance of communication in mental health treatment.
Data and Methodology
Data Sources: The analysis uses datasets from the NHS and the National Clinical Audit of Anxiety and Depression (NCAAD), covering outpatient and inpatient data, critical care metrics, and mental health service utilization.
Data Preparation: Data was meticulously cleaned and integrated from multiple sources, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the visualizations.
Merging and Linking Data: Advanced data merging techniques were employed to create a cohesive dataset, linking outpatient and inpatient data to facilitate a seamless analysis across NHS regions.
Visualization and Tools
Tableau Dashboards: Interactive dashboards provide a comprehensive view of NHS operations, allowing users to explore metrics such as service demand, patient demographics, and regional performance.
Visualization Design: The dashboards were designed with clarity and simplicity in mind, using consistent color schemes, styles, and symbols to ensure the data is easily digestible for NHS decision-makers.
Business Intelligence Impact
This project exemplifies the power of Business Intelligence (BI) in the healthcare sector. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, it enables NHS decision-makers to:

Optimize Resource Allocation: Identify and address regional disparities in healthcare delivery, ensuring resources are distributed where they are most needed.
Improve Patient Outcomes: Leverage data-driven insights to enhance the quality of care, particularly in critical areas such as mental health services.
Enhance Operational Efficiency: Analyze service demand trends and optimize operational processes to reduce waiting times and improve patient care delivery.
Skills Demonstrated
Skills: Tableau, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Data Analysis, Data Cleaning and Preparation, Dashboard Design, Healthcare Analytics.
